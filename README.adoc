= LITE-IDP

Customizations: 

Rudimentary implementation for HTTP-Redirect SingleLogoutService:
* metadata generation for IDP added
* Parses LogoutRequest comming from SP
* Response to LogoutRequest to SP's HTTP-Redirect endpoint
* destroy user's session in cache and invalidate IDP cookie

What is missing (actually a lot)
* parse SingleLogoutService endpoint from SP metadata
* in case of global logout other service providers are not notified
* HTTP-POST binding for logout service on IDP side
* support for HTTP-POST binding on SP side
