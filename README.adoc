= LITE-IDP Customizations

Rudimentary implementation for HTTP-Redirect SingleLogoutService:

#### What is implemented: 

* metadata generation for IDP added
* Parses LogoutRequest comming from SP
* Response to LogoutRequest to SP's HTTP-Redirect endpoint
* destroy user's session in cache and invalidate IDP cookie

#### What is missing (actually a lot): 

* parse SingleLogoutService endpoint from SP metadata
* in case of global logout other service providers are to be notified and shall be logged out too
* HTTP-POST binding for logout service on IDP side
* support for HTTP-POST binding on SP side
* error handling
* non success response to logout requests


Also the certificate based client authentication has been disabled so the browser does not ask you to present cert all the time when the login page is hit.
